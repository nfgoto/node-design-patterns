# Singleton Pattern

<!-- italics -->
***Intent:** Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it*

# Prototype Pattern

***Intent:** Specify the kinds of objects to create using prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype*

# Factory Pattern

***Intent:** Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses*

# Builder Pattern

***Intent:** Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so the same construction process can create different representations*

Solution to the ***telescoping constructor*** (too many arguments) antipattern
